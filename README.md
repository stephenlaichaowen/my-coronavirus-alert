# This is a Chrome extension project

## What it does
when a user visit a page that has coronavirus/新官肺炎 strings, the plugin make the texts blik so that if someone doesn't like to see it can just close the tab.

## How it works
Since Google Store stops taking submitted plugin after 3/24, so there is no need for developers to create plugins. we can only run the plugin locally.

Steps:
- go to [this page](chrome://extensions/)
- press the load unpacked item
